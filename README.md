# Wire

An open-source initiative to refine and share deliberate, code-first ecosystems that centralize knowledge and enhance builder productivity.

## Mission

Wire is an open-source initiative to optimize and enhance the tools and processes that empower builders. It’s about refining the development ecosystem to serve specific objectives while fostering deliberate and effective workflows.

As a consultant working across diverse organizations and ecosystems, I’ve observed a wide range of approaches to development. Wire is my attempt to curate, refine, and share a deliberate ecosystem designed to improve productivity, centralize knowledge, and inspire others in their own practices.

## Principles

### Code-First Ecosystem

Prioritize configurations, information, and processes managed through code. A minimal reliance on UI increases productivity and ensures reproducibility.

### Central Vault of Knowledge

Create a single, integrated repository for all relevant information, such as projects, client engagements, personal research, journaling, etc. A unified system reduces fragmentation and makes knowledge accessible.
